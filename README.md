The detection system provides a mechanism that automatically prevents popups,protecting the user from any malicious attacks. 
Also, the system creates a model of normal behavior from training data and uses it to detect attacks against Web Servers. 
The system in this model has associated each server-side program (path) of all the possible parameters found in the URL of each HTTP request. 
So each program knows the normal characteristics of the parameters through the use detection models can be seen when they deviate from normal levels. 
The accuracy of the system which is an important determinant of the effectiveness depends on the training phase. The phase of education contains files with a 
specified amount of data, which is net of attacks to web and help the system to create the normal behavior of the protected application.
